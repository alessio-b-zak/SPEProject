- A welcome screen may make the app more 'friendly' to new users, perhaps having a short 
  sentence on what the app is for.
  
- I think it could be made clearer how to get to the help page on what the icons mean.

I enjoyed having a go and have filled in the feedback form, but thought it would be 
better if I sent you some feedback by email with more of an explanation. I liked the 
layout, colour scheme and style which all looked really professional. Some things which 
I have questions about or that need a little improvement are:

- On the 'i' button it says that you can take a photo to submit a new pollution incident. 
We would like this to not just be about pollution but also for people to report 
interesting things, wildlife or other issues. So as well as pollution it could say and 
other river features.

- Is the data on the purple pin points from the Environment Agency? It isn't clear as to 
what this data is, where it has come from or what it means. Maybe on the 'I' icon you 
could briefly say what the data is, and when you click on an individual pin it would be 
good to have more information about that the data means and when the sample was taken.

- When you take a photo and click 'submit' where does it go? Is there somewhere that the 
photos are stored, and where we can download them from? It doesn't come up as a logged 
point on the map so how do we know where it was taken?

- How do we plot points on the map? Say if we are doing a walkover survey and want to 
record something, we take a photo, write a description and submit it, how do we make a 
logged point appear on the map that we can look at later to see what we recorded there? 
Could we just press and hold a location on the map to log a point?

- When you tag a photo and add a tag, we need to be able to add multiple tags to one 
photo to fully describe the land management.
